# How Do Satellites Communicate?
This exercise is meant to explore how do satellites communicate with ground stations. The aim of this exercise is to teach students about different electromagnetic waves, different ways of modulation, demodulation, possible losses due to external effects and the link budget fundamentals.

NOTE: This mini-lecture was created to last around 40 mins. It is constructed to brief students about satellite communications and it was not meant to be an interactive, collaborative lecture apart from possible crowd-interaction questions.

## Learning Objectives
1. LO1: The students identify different kind of categories within the electromagnetic spectrum and distinguish the ones that are used for data transfer,
2. LO2: The students understand why modulation is needed and how it is used,
3. LO3: The students are able to list potential disturbances that can alter the information that is sent from/to the ground station.

## Methods of Teaching
The method that is employed during this exercise is to have a slide deck that compromises of the theory behind and visuals behind the material that is being taught. 

Additionally, there will be an accompanying Jupyter notebook that can be converted to an exercise for the future. Currently, this Jupyter notebook serves as a tool to demonstrate modulation, link budget and disturbances from the environment.
